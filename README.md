# Awesome-DFL-papers

DFL (Decision Focused Learning) is a new framework designed to enhance performance in downstream optimization tasks through prediction. Instead of simply reducing the prediction error, it focuses on minimizing the decision error. I am currently researching in this field, and I created this repository to share interesting and excellent papers on DFL for other researchers and practitioners.
